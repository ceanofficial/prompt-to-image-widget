# prompt-to-image-widget
AI Image Widget is a framework-agnostic Web Component for prompt-to-image generation. It includes a secure Node/Express backend that proxies requests to the OpenAI Images API, keeping keys off the client. Users can refine prompts, choose size/quality/background/format, preview results, and download in PNG/JPEG/WebP.
